# **App Name**: ResuAI

## Core Features:

- Resume Upload: Allow users to upload their resume/CV in common formats like PDF or DOCX.
- AI Conversion: Use an LLM to analyze the uploaded resume, extracting key sections (e.g., experience, education, skills) and formatting it into an initial portfolio draft. The LLM should use reasoning to decide whether and where to include details.
- Edit Sections: Enable users to edit, rearrange, and customize the generated portfolio sections through a drag-and-drop interface.
- Theme Editor: Provide options for users to select from pre-designed themes to change the look and feel of their portfolio, like font choices, layouts and color.
- Generate Link: Generate a unique, shareable URL for the final portfolio website, which can be distributed for job applications or professional networking.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the generated portfolios are fully responsive and viewable on different devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) for a modern, professional look.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a neutral, clean backdrop, making the teal 'pop'.
- Accent color: Blue (#4682B4) as an analogous hue to Teal that works for interactive elements or highlights.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both body and headline. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a set of modern, line-style icons in teal to represent different sections and functions (e.g., experience, skills, contact).
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with ample whitespace, using a grid-based system for easy content arrangement.
- Incorporate subtle, unobtrusive animations for user interactions, such as a smooth transition when navigating between portfolio sections.
